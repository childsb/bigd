droparea is a HTML5 drag and drop image/file jQuery plug-in and a php script for 
server-side.

I added:

  * client-side image resizing with canvas on browser option
  * data url option for sending a file/image as a text field with ajax
  * click event for browsing files

I developed it to use on my Uygulama project's new version.

I've only tested it on 
  * Chromium (14.0.835.202), 
  * Google Chrome (15.0.874.120),
  * Mozilla Firefox (3.6.17) "has some bugs" 
and it works enough for me for now!
